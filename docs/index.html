<title>Freon Language Workbench</title>
<h1>Freon Language Workbench (Work in Progress)</h1>
<p>
This is the future homepage of Freon, a workbench for developing Domain Specific Languages (DSL) that work natively on the web.
</p>
<p>
This project is a direct descendent of <a href="https://www.projectit.org">ProjectIt</a>,
a projectional editor for the web.
</p>
<p>
Because the nature of ProjeectIt has changed from a tool to create a projectional editor to a tool to create a full DSL,
it was decided to change the name of the project.
